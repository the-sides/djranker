Use a bunch of add calls for adding track models, but don't worry about storing them under a session. 
Just give each request a class to describe the session each model would belong too. 
If the website is ever scaled, every track will be saved this way, (USE STRONGER ENGLISH) 
Find tracks sharing a session model id, NOT SID, and sort by the votes. 
Pass the object through ranklist/sid view 
THIS REPRESENTS A VOTING TABLE

Then as each vote is made, update the track model, 
    and link unique votes against particular ip addrs
    ^ This will need to be LATER IMPLEMENTED, focus on registering clicks accurately first.

As requests are made, sticking with a base num of points, they will be present after refreshes
Requesting a track will lead to an automatic refresh 

Need to find out how django IDs can be stored in other models
The id = AutoField() is simply and IntegerField and will be treated like such.
